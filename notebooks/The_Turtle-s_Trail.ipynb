    "The module provides imperative and object-oriented APIs. \n",
    "The imperative API consists of top-level functions that work as turtle commands like `fd(50)` etc.\n",
    "The OO API is provided by the `Turtle` class, which has methods such as `my_turtle.forward(50)`.\n",

    "The imperative API is built automatically at import time on top of the OO API, to avoid duplication.\n",

    "When you use a turtle command, behind the scenes it calls `get_turtle()`,\n",
    "which returns the pre-existing \"main turtle\", or creates a new one if there was no main turtle.\n",
    "The command then calls its corresponding method on the main turtle.\n",
